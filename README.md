## How it works

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/brand/architecture.png" alt="Your agent talks to Sam's agent: you text your agent, the two agents do the back-and-forth through Inkbox within the key you gave Sam, and you each get one question" width="900"></p>

You text a phone number. [Inkbox](https://inkbox.ai) gives the agent that number, an email address and an agent-to-agent endpoint. A small gateway wakes your agent, which lives in its own microVM on [Maritime](https://maritime.sh) with a Linux desktop. Inside, a [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) agent loop runs with your apps through [Composio](https://composio.dev), a wallet through [Stripe Link](https://docs.stripe.com/agentic-commerce/agents/link-agent-wallet), and a policy guard in front of every tool. Default model: Claude Fable 5.1. Any Pi provider works.

It writes real files, too: ask for a brief "as a PDF" and it creates one in its workspace and sends it to you as an iMessage or email attachment. Any app Composio supports can be connected by name ("connect my Notion"), and the prompt it runs with is a file you can read and edit (`instinct prompt`, `instinct persona`; see [CUSTOMIZE.md](docs/CUSTOMIZE.md)).

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/brand/stack.png" alt="Who does what: you text; Inkbox is identity and messaging; Maritime hosts one microVM with a desktop per person; inside it Pi runs the loop, Claude is the model, Composio connects apps, Stripe Link pays" width="900"></p>

## Who gets which key

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/brand/trust.png" alt="Six rings: owner, partner, family, friend, contact, stranger" width="820"></p>

Six tiers, enforced in code before any tool runs. Your partner's agent can read your calendar. A friend's can only ask when you are free. A stranger gets a polite no, and you get a one-line text saying who asked for what. Grants add exceptions in plain English: "Sam can book us dinner this week." Details in [PERMISSIONS.md](docs/PERMISSIONS.md) and [PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## Payments

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/brand/payments.png" alt="How the agent pays: you ask, it reaches checkout on its desktop, asks Stripe Link for a one-time card for the exact amount, you approve on your phone, it pays and reports" width="1000"></p>

The agent never holds your card. For each purchase it asks your Stripe Link wallet for a single-use card for the exact total, you approve with one tap, and the card is dead after the payment. Limits live in a spend policy file: ask above an amount, daily cap, and things that always need a yes. Without a wallet it still gets you to checkout and hands you the screen. Details: [PAYMENTS.md](docs/PAYMENTS.md).

## Privacy (Midnight)

The agent can keep your memories as **shielded commitments** on [Midnight](https://midnight.network/), so the chain never sees your words — only opaque 32-byte hashes. Ask it to prove something *about* a memory (that it exists, that it is a health note) and it produces a selective-disclosure proof that reveals nothing else. Spending can be gated the same way, against on-chain allowances.

```bash
node examples/midnight-demo.mjs           # offline demo, no key or wallet
pnpm --filter @open-instinct/midnight run test
instinct midnight status                   # mode, contracts, anchor counts
```

Three modes: `mock` (offline, deterministic, the default), `local` (midnight-local-dev), and `testnet` (real transactions with explorer links). The layer is off unless `MIDNIGHT_MODE` is set, so enabling it never changes a normal boot. Details: [MIDNIGHT.md](docs/MIDNIGHT.md) and [ARCH-MIDNIGHT.md](docs/ARCH-MIDNIGHT.md).

## Quick start

Node 22.19+ and pnpm 10. You bring your own keys; [KEYS.md](docs/KEYS.md) lists which ones and how to get them. No key is stored in this repository.

**On your laptop, no phone number yet**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariagorskikh/open-instinct && cd open-instinct
nvm use && corepack enable        # if corepack needs permissions: npm install -g pnpm@10
pnpm install && pnpm build
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
pnpm instinct init --name "Maria" --phone +14155550100 --email maria@example.com --handle maria-instinct
pnpm instinct dev                 # then, in another terminal:
pnpm instinct chat "remember that I like window seats"
```

**With an iMessage line**

```bash
export INKBOX_ADMIN_API_KEY=...   # inkbox.ai console
pnpm instinct init --name "Maria" --phone +14155550100 --email maria@example.com --handle maria-instinct
pnpm instinct dev --tunnel
pnpm instinct connect             # prints the number and the text to send: connect @maria-instinct
```

**The Instinct way: one agent per person on Maritime**

```bash
export MARITIME_API_KEY=mk_...    # maritime.sh, Settings, API keys
pnpm instinct deploy --image ghcr.io/mariagorskikh/open-instinct-agent:latest
```

For many people, run the [gateway](packages/gateway/README.md): a signup page that provisions an identity and an agent per person. Guide: [DEPLOY-MARITIME.md](docs/DEPLOY-MARITIME.md).

## Status

Version 0.1. Nine packages, 837 tests, a scripted end-to-end smoke test, and a cold-start test from a fresh clone. Live iMessage and Maritime deployment were exercised against real identities during development; treat them as beta. Logins, 2FA and payments go to you through a desktop takeover or a Link approval, never to the model alone.
